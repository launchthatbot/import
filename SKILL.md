# LaunchThatBot Agent Import

This skill lets you export your current OpenClaw agent configuration to a LaunchThatBot deployment. Your secrets (API keys, tokens) are encrypted before leaving this machine and are decrypted only inside your new container. LaunchThatBot never has access to the raw values.

## How It Works

This skill supports two import modes:

1. **Quick API mode**
   - The user generates a one-time import token from LaunchThatBot dashboard.
   - You call `import_handshake` (via `mcporter`) to fetch the RSA public key.
   - You encrypt secrets and call `import_push` directly to LaunchThatBot API.
2. **Air-gapped file mode**
   - The user generates an air-gapped session from LaunchThatBot dashboard and downloads a session JSON (contains token + public key metadata).
   - You read that session file locally, collect config/memory/skills/env, encrypt secrets, and produce an encrypted bundle file.
   - The user uploads that bundle file in LaunchThatBot dashboard (mobile/PWA supported).

In both modes, token/session is one-time + short-lived and the target container is restarted after import.

## Security Model

This skill is built around the question: "Why would I share my API keys with a platform I have never heard of?"

The answer: **you are not sharing them with us.**

- **Your secrets never touch the LaunchThatBot database.** They pass through the API as an opaque, RSA-encrypted blob. Only the target container holds the private key.
- **The import token is single-use and time-limited.** It expires in 15 minutes and is consumed on first use. Even if intercepted, it cannot be replayed.
- **All communication happens over HTTPS** with an additional layer of RSA-OAEP encryption on secrets.
- **After import, your secrets live in your own container's `.env` file** on your VPS. You can SSH in and verify them.

## When the User Asks to Export

When the user says something like "export my config to LaunchThatBot" or "migrate to LaunchThatBot", follow these steps:

## MCP + mcporter Prerequisite

This skill is **mcporter-first** for OpenClaw/Pi compatibility.

Before running this flow, verify prerequisites in this order:

1. Check `mcporter` is runnable:

```bash
mcporter --version || npx -y mcporter --version
```

If this fails, tell the user:

- "`mcporter` is required for this skill. Please enable `npx mcporter` (or install/configure mcporter), then run import again."

2. Check LaunchThatBot MCP is configured and discoverable:

```bash
(mcporter list || npx -y mcporter list)
(mcporter list launchthatbot --schema || npx -y mcporter list launchthatbot --schema)
```

If `launchthatbot` is not available, attempt automated setup (if environment allows) and then re-check. If automation is blocked, ask the user to configure LaunchThatBot MCP manually.

Recommended MCP config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "launchthatbot": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@launchthatbot/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "LAUNCHTHATBOT_API_KEY": "ltb_sk_..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

3. Validate import tools are available before continuing:

```bash
(mcporter list launchthatbot --schema || npx -y mcporter list launchthatbot --schema)
```

Confirm `import_handshake` and `import_push` exist.

### Step 1: Collect Information from the User

Ask the user for:

1. **Import Token** -- a 64-character hex string from the LaunchThatBot dashboard
2. **API URL** -- the LaunchThatBot API URL (default: `https://api.ltb.it.com`)

The user gets the import token by clicking **Import Agent** on their agent's detail page in the LaunchThatBot dashboard.

### Step 2A (Quick API): Fetch the Public Key (Handshake via mcporter)

Call LaunchThatBot MCP through `mcporter`:

```
npx -y mcporter call launchthatbot.import_handshake \
  importToken:"<importToken>" \
  apiUrl:"https://api.ltb.it.com"
```

Response:

```json
{
  "publicKey": "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\n...\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----",
  "agentName": "My Agent",
  "expiresAt": 1708000000000
}
```

If the response is a 401, the token is invalid, expired, or already used. Ask the user to generate a new one.

### Step 2B (Air-gapped): Read Session File

If the user chooses air-gapped mode, read the session file provided by LaunchThatBot dashboard and extract:

- `importToken`
- `publicKey`
- `expiresAt`
- optional `apiUrl`

Do not call `import_handshake` in air-gapped mode if the session file already includes a valid `publicKey`.

### Step 3: Collect Agent Data

Gather the following from the local filesystem:

**soul.md** (agent personality/instructions):

- Check `/home/node/.openclaw/config/agents/*/soul.md`
- Or wherever the agent's soul.md is located

**Memory files**:

- Check `/home/node/.openclaw/memory/`
- Include all `.md` and `.json` files

**Skills**:

- Check `/home/node/.openclaw/skills/`
- Include all skill directories and their contents
- Exclude this skill (`launchthatbot-import`) from the export

**Environment secrets** (`.env` file):

- Read `/home/node/.openclaw/.env`
- Parse each `KEY=VALUE` line
- These will be encrypted before sending

### Step 4: Confirm with the User

Before sending anything, show the user a summary:

- Number of config files found
- Number of memory files found
- Number of skill directories found
- Number of environment variables found (show keys only, never values)

Ask the user to confirm they want to proceed.

### Step 5: Encrypt Secrets

For each secret from the `.env` file, encrypt the VALUE using the RSA public key fetched from the handshake endpoint. Use RSA-OAEP with SHA-256 padding.

```javascript
const crypto = require("crypto");

function encryptSecret(value, publicKeyPem) {
  const encrypted = crypto.publicEncrypt(
    {
      key: publicKeyPem,
      padding: crypto.constants.RSA_PKCS1_OAEP_PADDING,
      oaepHash: "sha256",
    },
    Buffer.from(value, "utf8"),
  );
  return encrypted.toString("base64");
}
```

If encryption fails, verify the public key is a valid PEM string starting with `-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----`.

### Step 6A (Quick API): Send the Payload (via mcporter)

Send everything via LaunchThatBot MCP through `mcporter`:

```
npx -y mcporter call launchthatbot.import_push --args '{
  "importToken": "<importToken>",
  "apiUrl": "https://api.ltb.it.com",
  "payload": {
    "config": {
      "soulMd": "<contents of soul.md>",
      "memory": [
        { "filename": "MEMORY.md", "content": "<file contents>" },
        { "filename": "daily-log.json", "content": "<file contents>" }
      ],
      "skills": [
        { "path": "web-search/SKILL.md", "content": "<file contents>" },
        { "path": "email-sender/SKILL.md", "content": "<file contents>" }
      ]
    },
    "encryptedSecrets": [
      { "key": "OPENAI_API_KEY", "ciphertextB64": "<base64 encrypted value>" },
      { "key": "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY", "ciphertextB64": "<base64 encrypted value>" }
    ]
  }
}'
```

### Step 7: Report Results

If successful, tell the user:

- How many config files were written to the new container
- How many secrets were imported
- That the container was automatically restarted to pick up the new configuration
- That they can verify their secrets by SSHing into their VPS or checking the Convex dashboard
- That they can now safely shut down this old instance

If it fails, report the error and suggest generating a new import token from the LaunchThatBot dashboard.

### Step 6B (Air-gapped): Write Bundle File for User Upload

If the user selected air-gapped mode, do not push to API from the old instance. Instead, write a local bundle file for the user:

```json
{
  "schema": "ltb-airgap-import@1",
  "importToken": "<importToken>",
  "apiUrl": "https://api.ltb.it.com",
  "payload": {
    "config": {
      "soulMd": "...",
      "memory": [{ "filename": "MEMORY.md", "content": "..." }],
      "skills": [{ "path": "web-search/SKILL.md", "content": "..." }]
    },
    "encryptedSecrets": [{ "key": "OPENAI_API_KEY", "ciphertextB64": "<...>" }]
  }
}
```

Tell the user to upload this bundle in LaunchThatBot:

- Admin -> Agent -> Import Agent -> Air-gapped File mode -> Upload bundle

## Important Exclusions

Do NOT include in the export:

- This skill itself (`launchthatbot-import/`)
- The `convex-backend` skill (it will be re-provisioned by LaunchThatBot)
- Any `.git` directories
- `node_modules` directories
- Temporary files or caches
- Lock files (`package-lock.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, etc.)
